More user feedback and continuous improvement are always needed, and there is no fast path for experience work. In terms of testing, we provide simple integration testing methods, which play the role of smoke testing, but this is not enough. We are trying to ensure correctness based on constraints and rules rather than tests. In terms of work interface, we hope to build an IDE-based dev workspace and continue to enhance and optimize the internal workflow experience. At the same time, we hope to continue to improve coverage and technical capabilities. In addition, we also hope to apply the practice method more widely in CI and operation workflow, and other scenarios, to shorten end-user awareness and end-to-end workflow. At present, KusionStack is still in the very early stage of open source, and there is a lot of work to be done in the future. The most important thing is that we hope to share the concepts and practices of our platform engineering with more companies and teams, to promote and witness some interesting changes together."),(0,o.kt)("h2",{id:"8-reference"},"8.
